## Description

Create a Python program that picks a number at random which you must guess within 5 chances.

## Objectives

Understand the basics of loops, conditional statements, and functions in the Python programing language.

### Normal Mode

Create a program that will choose a number (it can be random if you like) and will ask you to pick the same number.

#### Rules

 - If the number you pick is lower than the computer's number - it needs to tell you that your guess was too low.
 - If the number you pick is higher than the computer's number - it needs to tell you that your guess was too high.
 - If you pick the same number as the computer, the game is over.
 - The program must output the number of turns you took.
 - (optional) Tell the user if they are close.

### Hard Mode

Complete all requirements of Normal Mode.

Create a version of the game that asks you to pick the number.  The computer then takes guesses at what the number is.

All of the same rules as the Normal Mode apply to the computer.

### Very Hard Mode

Complete all requirements of Hard Mode, optimize the computer's strategy so it improves it's performance and guesses in fewer turns.
